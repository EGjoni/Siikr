<div id = "maintenance-notice"> <b>Notice:</b> Siikr is currently in a lot of pain. <span style="font-size:1.3em; color:pink;">Indexing of new blogs is temporarily disabled</span>, and search quality and performance may be degraded over the next few days as I make optimizations and crunch numbers. <b>It is very likely that new blogs might fail to index at all</b>. I'm working on it!
</br> The goal here is an anticipated 50% drop in disk use, resulting in a lower probability of your blog getting ejected from the index, a decrease in downtime frequency, less noisy wordclouds, and a generally higher tolerance to the abuse you subject my poor server to.

<h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif;">You are not dumb.<br/><span style="font-size: 0.4em;">Or maybe you are, but definitely not for this reason!</span><br/>The feature is actively hiding from you.<br/>A post will be made on <a href="https://tumblr.com/blog/siikr" target="_blank" style='color: cyan !important;'>Siikr's blog</a> when the feature is available again.<br/> I think sometime this week.</h3>
